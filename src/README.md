All LaTeX and markdown files must be put under this directory.

If you put `media` or `.sty` files under this directory, they will only be visible in the directory where you put it, (not its subdirectories).

If you wish to put LaTeX files in subdirectories of directories you can, but you then force users to use the Makefile given instead of their editor's default compilation. [See this](https://github.com/cirosantilli/latex-submodule#recursive) for details.
